        <p>Growing up my mom took us to the Kensington Library everyday after school. We would win tickets to go to the museums in center city, so on weekends my mo would pack us a lunch and take us to the parkway where some of our museums are. This very library, Parkway central, was where my mom, my three sisters and I completed every one of those weekend trips to the parkway. We would pick twelve books each and take the Market Frankfurt Line back to what felt like a world away, Kensington. It reamins one of my favorite places in the city. </p>
