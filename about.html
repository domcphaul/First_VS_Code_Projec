    <p>My best friend is a sex therpist, and she has a book club for her patients. Though it would be unethical for her to treat me, she doooes let me come to book club. This was one of the books for this month. It's very good and written by Da"shaun Harrison. It's about fatphobia and the intersections of anti-Blackness and fatphobia./p>
